## How can I deploy this project?

Simply open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/33086a0b-dc74-42e0-bf4d-0baa3ad2b87a) and click on Share -> Publish.

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain then we recommend using Netlify. Visit our docs for more details: [Custom domains](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain/)

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Get your API keys:
   - HuggingFace API key from [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
   - Supabase credentials from your project settings
   - X.AI API key from [X.AI dashboard](https://x.ai/dashboard)

3. Update `.env` with your keys

### Testing HuggingFace API Key

1. After setting up your environment, start the development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```

2. Open your browser's developer tools (F12)
3. Look for the console message:
   - "HuggingFace API key is valid!" - Your key is working
   - "API Authentication Error" - Your key needs to be checked

Note: Make sure your HuggingFace API key has read access to the model

### API Integration

Docwiz uses the X.AI API with the Grok model for quiz generation. The API is fully compatible with the OpenAI API format, making it easy to integrate and maintain.

### Configuration

The API is configured in `src/config/index.ts`:
```typescript
export const config = {
  ai: {
    model: 'grok-2-1212',
    apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_XAI_API_KEY,
    baseUrl: 'https://api.x.ai/v1'
  }
}
```

### Quiz Generation

Quizzes are generated using a structured prompt that ensures consistent formatting and high-quality questions. The system supports:

- Multiple choice questions
- Automatic answer validation
- Context-aware question generation
- Customizable number of options
